# Delete

:::tip Goal
The `delete` Work Tasks is well suited to all cases where you wish to subset an existing database

When working with large databases it might be necessary to subset the data before further anonymizing the data.

:::

## Considerations

When determining the records that need to be deleted, it is important to understand the structure so that the correct table data deletion sequence is followed.
However, if the database has proper foreign key definitions, dbMasker can facilitate the process of establishing all dependent tables.

Start with tables that have no parent tables and decide on which data in the tables to delete.
All dependent data in dependent tables following the foreign key structure, will also be automatically marked for deletion.

You may remove any dependency or manually add dependencies on other tables.

## Work Task `delete` in Ano

In `delete` Work Tasks, you can define [sql](../../rules/sql-before-after), [where clause](../../rules/where-expressions), [method](#method) and [cascade](#cascade)

[Visit the rules section](../../rules/overview) for more information on how to write `delete` task rules.

## `method`

The 3 cascading delete methods have different performance of deleting a hierarchy of records. The characteristics are:

- cascading

  Children are deleted first, and the parent last

  Generally works without disabling constraints

  Slow performance (one by one)

- not-exists

  Parent is deleted first

  DELETE FROM parent WHERE XX

  Thereafter all orphans are deleted using

  DELETE FROM child WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT \* FROM parent WHERE parent.id = child.parent_id)

  Fastest, but constraints must be disabled

- not-in

Parent is deleted first

    Thereafter all orphans are deleted using

    WHERE child.parent_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT parent.id FROM parent)

## `cascade`

`cascade` deletes data from dependant tables.
