# Create

:::tip Goal
The `create` Work Tasks lets you write rules that populates tables with generated data.

- Useful for populating empty databases for testing and development purposes

:::

## Considerations

When populating a specific database table, all columns must be populated by rules at the same time (else they remain `null`).
As such, it requires more ANO to write `create` tasks than `update` tasks, as `updates` needs only rules for certain columns.

The `create` tasks is well suited to all cases where you have the database table structure, but you do not have any table data.

## ANO Structure

```ano
task CreateTasks {                                   // Task Group
    ...
    create <table> <task-name>                          // create Work Task
        <rules>
}
```
