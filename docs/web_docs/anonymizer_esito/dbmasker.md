# DBmasker

> DBmasker is a service that helps organizations manage the tasks
> associated with masking data in a robust and secure manner. It
> allows the user to create multiple tasks, each performing different
> masking or anonymization actions.

> The process involves the following:

1.  Identifying sensitive data that needs to be
    masked/anonymized

2.  Writing a set of rules in a masking/anonymizing
    domain-specific language (ANO) that masks, deletes or
    creates data and organizes them into tasks

3.  Generating a Java program from your masking and
    anonymization rules, using the DBmasker service

4.  Deploying the generated Java program and performing the
    masking on the target database(s)

- The generated program does it all, your obligation is only
  to run it

- No lock-in, you can maintain the generated code separately

- Supports JDBC based RDBMS like Oracle, SQL Server, Sybase,
  MySQL, PostgreSQL

- May be run as CLI program or be embedded in your
  application of choice

- Simple, repeatable, and easy to use. You may run the
  generated program many times
