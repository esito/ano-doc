g9 Anonymizer can produce databases anonymized for test- and development, equivalent to the DBmasker service.

The g9 Database Import Eclipse plugin supports converting database schemas to an Ecore or Xcore model, or Java JPA source code.

### [g9 Modeling Tools](https://www.esito.no/en/promo-g9/)

Following the model-driven approach to software development, g9 is a development environment that can manage the complexities of application development. It can import a domain and application UML model into its workspace and add abstract data and user interface modeling. Both front-end and back-end application code can be created using its template based generators.
