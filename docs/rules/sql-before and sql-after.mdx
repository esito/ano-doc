# `sql-before` and `sql-after`

:::tip Goal
There may arise cases in your database structure that requires certain complete SQL statements to run before and after the anonymizations can be done.

- `sql-before` allows you to write complete SQL statements that are run before tasks.
- `sql-after` allows you to write complete SQL statements that are run after tasks.

These complete SQL statements may be run before and after

1. the task root (e.g. before all task groups)
2. a specific task group (e.g. a specific `task <task> {...}`)
3. a specific work task (e.g. a specific `update <table>`)

:::

:::warning Custom SQL notes

- There will be no check of SQL syntax
- Any occurrences of double quotes or backslash inside a SQL statement must be escaped with a backslash: \" and \\.
- A single statement cannot be divided on serveral lines. Multiple SQL statements may be written divided by newline

:::

## Use cases for custom `sql-before` and `sql-after`

The `sql-before` and `sql-after` may be useful to

- temporarily remove table constraints
- temporarliy allow inserts into primary-key columns
- delete rows according to conditions, i.e. delete rows with null values
- do other CRUD operations you require, but that are not handled by ano-logic

## Ano Structure and Example

<Tabs
  defaultValue="placement"
  values={[
    { label: 'Placements in .ano', value: 'placement' },
    { label: 'Work Task Example', value: 'work-task' },
  ]}
>

<TabItem value="placement">

```ano
// Root SQL statements
sql-before "SELECT 1;"            // before all tasks
sql-after "SELECT 1;"             // after all tasks

task <task2>
// Task Group SQL statements
sql-before "SELECT 2.1;"            // before <task1>
sql-after "SELECT 2.1;"             // after <task1>
{
    update <table1>
        // Work Task SQL statements
  	  	sql-before "SELECT 3.1;"  // before update <table1>
        sql-after "SELECT 3.1;"   // after update <table1>
        <table1-anonymizations>

    update <table2>
        sql-before "SELECT 3.2;"  // before update <table2>
        sql-after "SELECT 3.2;"   // before update <table2>
        <table2-anonymizations>
}


task <task2>
sql-before "SELECT 2.2;"            // before <task2>
sql-after "SELECT 2.2;"             // after <task2>
{
  ...
}

```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="work-task">

```ano
table Customer
    column text lastname size 50
    ...

task <task> {
    update Customer
        sql-before "delete from Customer where lastname is null"
        mask lastname
            format %s
            file src/main/resources/lastname.txt random-order
}
```

#### Work Task Example

- We do not want table `Customer` rows where `lastname = null` to be part of the database, so we delete these before performing the anonymization

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## How to trigger execution of the SQL statements

### Task Root SQL statements

The task Root SQL statements are only executed when you specifically use the `run` command only, in the DBmasker command line:

> run

If you perform a `run <task-group>` or a `run <work-task>`, Task Root SQL statements will **NOT** be executed.

Note that `run` will trigger all SQL Statements.

### Task Group SQL statements

The task group SQL statements are only executed when you specifically use the `run` or the `run <task-group>` commands, in the DBmasker command line:

> run

> run `<task-group>`

If you perform a `run <work-task>`, Task Group SQL statements will **NOT** be executed.

Note that `run <task-group>` will also trigger all Work Task SQL statements residing in that specific Task Group.

### Work Task SQL statements

The work task SQL statements are executed whenever the work task is triggered, either by `run`, by `run <task-group>` where the work task resides, or by the specific `run <work-task>` command.

> run

> run `<task-group>`

> run `<work-task>`
