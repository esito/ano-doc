# Task Group

The Task Group is the top level, and contains your Work Tasks.

## Task Group structure

![alt text](/img/docs/ano-syntax/task.png 'Task')

```ano
task <your-task-group-name> {                               // This is a Task Group

    update <database-table-tame> <optional-work-task-name>  // This is a Work Task
        mask <column-name>          // This is a Rule
            ...                         // Rule logic
        mask <column-name>          // This is a Rule
            ...                         // Rule logic
}
```

The **TASK** represents a task name and **sql** represents SQL statements run before and after the task defined operations.

> The **update**, **create**, **delete**, **erase** and **sar** are all Work Tasks and may be run as a task with the implicit name given by the task type and the TABLE name as in "update_CUSTOMER". A **NAME** may be given and it will override the implicit name.
