# Get Started With DBMasker

## Using DBmasker requires you to

1. [Translate your database structure into ANO syntax](./step1-sql-to-ano.md)
2. [Writing Your Tasks and Rules in ANO syntax](./step2-writing-ano.mdx)
3. [Generate and Configure your Java Application](./step3-application-generation-and-config.md)
4. [Run The Generated Application](./step4-run-app.md)


## But first - Identify your sensitive data

Look through your database and ask yourself what data should must be masked. Decide which columns in which tables of your relational database that should not be shown to developers and testers. Following are examples of data that would normally need masking:

- Names
- birth dates
- phone number
- address
- ID numbers
- credit card information
- etc...
