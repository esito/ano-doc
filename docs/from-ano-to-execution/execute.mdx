# Execute Tasks from the Java Application

:::tip Goal
After the Java Application is configured, you will execute it to run the anonymization tasks.

1. DBmasker command line tools
2. Execute using Intellij
3. Execute using the Command Line only

:::

## Execute tasks using Intellij

1. Open the Java application in Intellij as a Maven project
2. Click `Add Configuration...`
3. Click `add new` and select `Application`
4. Under **Build and Run**, provide the _Main class_
   - Default is `example.anonymizer.Anonymizer`
5. In the _Program Arguments_, write `cmd`

## Execute using the Command Line

Run the maven install command

> mvn install

This will provide you with a `target/<name>-0.0.1.jar` file. Execute this file by using

> java -jar target/<name\>-0.0.1.jar cmd

## The DBmasker command line tools

"cmd" is a command that takes continued input from standard input. The program displays the command help text and is ready for commands.

```
Reading internal config.properties
Commands:
trace                 - shows more messages
help                  - shows this page
config                - creates a local config.properties used for changing connection parameters
ping                  - test database connection
tasks                 - outputs list of tasks
run                   - runs all tasks except erase and sar tasks
run <tasks>           - runs a list of space delimited tasks, erase and sar actions are excluded
erase <task> <params> - runs erase actions for a specified task with a series of space delimited parameters
                        if parameter contains a space, surround it with quotation marks
sar <task> <params>   - creates a SAR export for a specified task with a series of space delimited parameters
                        xml and json files will be created in working directory
cmd                   - takes continued input from standard input (stdin)
quit                  - quits program
>
```

Use the `task` command to list the available tasks. Use the `run` command to execute all the tasks. Use the `run <task>` to execute specific Task Groups or Work Tasks.
