# Naming Conventions in ANO

:::tip Pro Tip

- Name every Task Group, Work Task, and Rule explicitly.

This solves name clash issues when generating the Java Application classes.

CamelCase recommended.

:::

## Task Group Names

Giving two Task Groups the same name makes it impossible to distinguish between them when running a specific task group, using

> run <task-group\>

## Work Tasks Names

Work Task names are optional. if not provided, it will default to `<task>_<table>`

### Default Naming

```
    CREATE Address minimum-rows 100 // --> CREATE_Address
        ...
    UPDATE Customer                 // --> Update_Customer
        ...
```

### Recommended Explicit Naming

```
    CREATE Address CreateAddressRows minimum-rows 100
        ...
    UPDATE Customer UpdateCustomerSomeRows
        ...
```

:::note Note

- If two Work Tasks have the same name inside the same Task Group, the last Work Task will override the first Work Task.
- If two Work Tasks have the same name inside different Task Groups, both Work Tasks will be run when running a specific Work Task using

> run <work-task\>

:::

## Rule Names

Rule names are optional. if not provided, it will default to `<rule>_<column>`

### Default Naming

```
    mask name         // --> mask_name
        ...
    randomize created // --> randomize_created
        ...
```

### Recommended Explicit Naming

```
    mask name MaskNameUsingFiles
        ...
    randomize created RandomizeCreatedDate
        ...
```

:::note Note

If two Rules have the same name inside the same Work Task, the last Rule will override the first Rule.
