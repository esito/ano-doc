# DBano - Translating your SQL to ANO

:::tip Goal

It is a necessary step to translate your database structure into the ANO DSL Language.
This entails translating your `CREATE TABLE` statements and constraints into an `.ano` file.

- [Our DBano service](#) will do this automatically for you. When provided a `.sql` file containing your database structure,
  it generates an `.ano` file where tables, columns and constraints are described in the ANO language.
- In the `.ano` file, you will write anonymization tasks and rules for your database.
- The `.ano` file will be [provided as input to our DBmasker Service](#). This will generate the application that will run your anonymization tasks and rules.

:::

:::info Recommendation

- [Install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to read and write `.ano` files
- This allows you to [install and use our ANO extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Esito.vscode-ano)
  - It provides error checking, syntax highlighting, syntax completion, hover information, and on-save formatting
