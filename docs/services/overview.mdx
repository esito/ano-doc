# Anonymizer Services

:::tip Services

Anonymizer provides you with the following services:

1. [DBano (free)](../dbano)
2. [DBmasker (paid)](../dbmasker)
3. [DBimport (free)](../dbimport)

They all require [login](../access) to access.

:::

## DBano

[The free service Dbano](../dbano) is a file generator. It takes an `.sql` file as input and generates an `.ano` file as output.

- The `.sql` file is meant to contain the database definition. I.e. the DDL of `CREATE` table statements and their constraints. We support the main database provider dialects.
- The `.ano` file will describe your database definitions in the ANO language.

## DBmasker

[The paid service DBmasker](../dbmasker) is a Java Application generator. It takes an `.ano` file as input and generates a `.zip` as output.

- The `.ano` file will contain your database definitions in addition to the anonymizing Tasks and Rules.
- The `.zip` file will contain a fully working Spring Boot Java 8 application running on Maven. By running this application, it will perform the anonymizing Tasks and Rules on your database.

## DBimport

[The free service DBimport](../dbimport) is a standalone generator that takes an `.sql` file as input and provides you with the Java entity classes for all tables described in the .sql file.
