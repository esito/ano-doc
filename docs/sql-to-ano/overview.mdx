# From SQL To Ano

:::tip Overview

Different database service providers use different database dialects.

Therefore, to start writitng ANO Tasks and Rules, it is a necessary step to describe the database definition in the ANO Language, that is database agnostic.

:::

## The ANO Language

[The ANO Language](.././the-ano-language) is a Domain Specific Language created for the purpose of anonymization. It uses [its own ANO types](../ano-types).

## Translating from SQL to ANO

- [Use DBano to translate DDL statements in SQL to ANO](../translate-to-ano)

When this is done, you may freely write [ANO Tasks](../../tasks/overview) and [ANO Rules](../../rules/overview) according to [the ANO Language](../the-ano-language).

## Writing code in ANO

Since ANO has its own syntax it is recommended to write ANO using Visual Studio Code, which is a free code editor available for Windows, Mac, and Linux:

- [Install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to read and write `.ano` files
- [Install and use our ANO extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Esito.vscode-ano)
  - It provides error checking, syntax highlighting, syntax completion, hover information, and on-save formatting
